# DevPulse – My Journey Building an AI-Powered Developer Productivity Tool

## Day 0 – \[June 26, 2025]

* 🔍 I started by searching for **real AI software problems** that companies care about but most students ignore.
* ❌ I didn’t want to build another social issue project or clone app. I wanted something that would **catch the attention of CTOs and recruiters**.
* 🤖 Searched terms like:

  * "AI problems companies urgently want solved"
  * "internal developer tools problem statements"
  * "how companies measure productivity of devs"
* 💡 Realized that **code churn, review delays, and tech debt** were hidden problems every company faces — but very few students even understand them.
* 🔎 Found forums where engineers complained about delivery issues, and read GitHub blog posts on metrics like DORA, PR latency, etc.
* ✅ Finalized my problem: **AI-powered GitHub activity analyzer to improve developer productivity**.
* 🧠 Named the project: `DevPulse`.

## Day 1 – \[June 27, 2025]

* ✅ Created repo `DevPulse`, added Apache 2.0 license, and started initial commit.
* 🧱 Set up folders: `src/`, `public/`, `proof/`, `docs/`
* 📄 Created `README.md`, `devlog.md`, `prompts.md`, `architecture.md`
* 💭 Started thinking about what core metrics to include.
* 🔐 Decided to keep daily evidence in `proof/` including screen recordings and logs.
